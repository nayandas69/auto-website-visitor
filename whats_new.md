# What's New in v0.0.8

#### New Features & Improvements

**1. `.deb` Package Now Available**
You can now install **Auto Website Visitor** on any **Debian-based Linux system** (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.) using our brand-new `.deb` package.
This makes setup easier, faster, and more system-integrated for Linux users.

> ðŸ”— Download the `.deb` package from the [latest release](https://github.com/nayandas69/auto-website-visitor/releases/latest).

To install it:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i auto-website-visitor_<version>_amd64.deb
```
> Replace `<version>` with the actual version number of the downloaded package.
> This also adds the `awv` command globally on your system.

**2. New CLI Command: `awv` for PIP Users**

For users who install the tool via `pip`, we've added a simpler and shorter command:

```bash
awv
```
you can run  two commands when you install via `pip`.

So whether you're using `pip install auto-website-visitor`, you can now run:

```bash
awv --help
```

**Update Now**
Run the following to upgrade via pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade auto-website-visitor
```
