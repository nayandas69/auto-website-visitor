## **Supported Versions**  

We only drop security updates for the **latest version** of the project.  
If you’re chillin’ with an old version, it’s time to glow up!    

| **Version** 🛠️ | **Status** 🚦 |  
|---------------|----------------|  
| **0.0.6** 🔐 | ✅ **Fully Supported.** This version is **security supported**—no cap. 🛡️✨ |  
| **0.0.5** 💀 | ❌ **Unsupported.** Once the star, now out of favor. ⏳ |  
| **0.0.4** 😣 | ❌ **Unsupported.** This version had its moment, but we’ve moved on. ⏩ |  
| **0.0.3** 🤡 | ❌ **Unsupported.** Too old, too risky. Get with the times. ⌛ |  
| **0.0.2** 😑 | ❌ **Unsupported.** If you’re still using this... just why? 😭 |  
| **0.0.1** 💤 | ❌ **Unsupported.** This relic belongs in a museum. 🚫 |

**TL;DR:** If you ain’t on **v0.0.5**, you’re missing out.
